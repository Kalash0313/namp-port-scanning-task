 Cyber Security Internship Task 1: Scan Local Network for Open Ports
 Objective:
To discover open ports on devices in the local network to understand network exposure.

 Tools Used:
- Nmap (Free)

 IP Range Used:
- 172.20.10.0/24

 Command Executed:
nmap -sS 172.20.10.0/24


 Sample Scan Result Summary:
- Device 1: 172.20.10.1 - Open Ports: 80 (HTTP), 443 (HTTPS)
- Device 2: 172.20.10.5 - Open Ports: 22 (SSH), 139 (NetBIOS)
- Device 3: 172.20.10.8 - Open Ports: 445 (SMB)

Security Risk Observations:
- Port 445 can expose systems to SMB-related vulnerabilities (e.g., EternalBlue).
- Port 22 should be restricted or use key-based authentication.
- Web ports (80/443) should be monitored for outdated web servers.

Recommendations:
- Close unused ports using firewall rules.
- Use secure protocols (e.g., SSH, HTTPS).
- Keep systems updated and patched regularly.
